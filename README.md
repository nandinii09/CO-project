### Path To Run Assembler
 - CO-project -> CO_A_P1 -> Simple-Assembler -> Assembler.py
#### To view all changes and history view Old_Assembler 

 ### ASUMPTIONS:
  
  - Label type instruction: only 1 label declaration per line i.e, ":"occurs only once.
  
  - Mov R1 FLAGS is taken to be a valid command since FLAGS doesn't represent a variable but instead represents a valid register name , where 
  - MOV can be used with two types of instructions , type1- mov register value , mov reg1 reg2 , hence we have taken to be a valid name
  - Use of FLAG register:
    - 'FLAGS' is a valid register name
    - mov reg1 FLAGS is the only valid  instruction involving FLAG register.
